## Manifesto or Antithesis?

**Good artists copy, great artists steal.** (Yates et al. 1967)

_Playing around with the idea of an open company and exploring what that means. Our world is already so bound and licensed - everyone wants their piece of the pie.  Our goal is to let everyone eat their pie. We provide the tin the pie is cooked in and endeavor to comply with all applicable standards. We don't provide the table you eat the pie on, we encourage you to use a cloth napkin. Where is the spoon and the fork in this allegory? Remember there is no spoon. Forks are welcome and encouraged._ However we have nothing against tables, and encourage you to shop around and try several tables during a lifetime. We also don't take ourselves too seriously. Yes this is all metaphor for what we do.


```tongue-in-cheek``` **Good code is forked, great code is stolen.**
